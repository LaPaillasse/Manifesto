Manifesto
=========

Here is the manifesto of La Paillasse and its forth coming services

We think our world needs a future where new scientific and technological innovations are more accessible, open and sustainable.  And we believe that the best way to realize the right disruptions is to first call to collective wisdom as there is no monopole for great ideas as we are smarter as a whole than alone. However open science and technology can't efficiently be developped within traditional walls like the ones of academic labs, where you can't work on whatever you want, with whoever you want and however you want... So we decided to build a new plateform to the service of a new generation of biohackers, makers, entrepreneurs, artists and amateurs, with a physical and international network of open and community laboratories and a virtual hub for cristalizing the unique diversity of both the community and its projects.
